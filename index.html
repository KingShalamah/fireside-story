    <p>It was a dark and stormy night in Memphis. We were out on Beale Street celebrating the end of LaunchCode.</p>
	
	<p>So, we decided to try some karaoke at the restaurant next door to Club 152. Everyone was excited for karaoke. We got to Club 152 and it was closed due to rats.</p>
	
	<p>Since the club was overtaken by rats, we decided to go eat at Denny's instead.<br />
	I was hungry and wanted to eat some of their Salted Caramel Banana Cream pancakes<br />
	anyway.
